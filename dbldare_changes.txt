Double Dare:
issue: no good way to deal with reverse-perspective prob
	reverse screen for examiner
	reverse once at beginngin...
	+25 +50 +10 -> only should be avail to current team
		correct, wrong, dare buttons
		on certain actions (dare), disappear
		buttons for current team and appear
		buttons for new team in control
		dare -> dbl dare -> phys challenge
		phys chall timer + normal timer
	basically, let examiner see correct order at beg
	and then switch to audience flipped view, and after
	that, only have buttons avail for currently acting
	team.
Have additional +25/-25 buttons for every team (always vis)
to correct scoring mistakes.

Highlight current team instead of creating new buttons?
Better way? Best way?

-----------------------------------------------------------

Needed tweaks:

* Everything needs to be a bigger size.  Compare sizes with
  my program.
* Point values for everything need to be doubled.  instead
  of 25 50 100, the increments need to be 50 100 200.  This
  also affects the +25 and -25 buttons - they should be +50
  and -50.
* The "Completed" and "Failed" buttons should stay behind
  when the Physical Challenge timer runs out.  This way if
  a team completes the challenge at the last second we can
  choose to give it to them.
* When the Physical Challenge timer is being stopped, there
  should be a +0:15 and -0:15 button next to it.  Also, the
  default value should be 0:30.
* The "Last Minute" control was really just for debugging;
  this should be removed in the final program.


"Nice" tweaks:

* Change "Switch control" to "Give control".  Saying "Switch
  control" makes me think the button will toggle it.
* It would be nice if the window could be maximized.
* I'd prefer "Complete" and "Incomplete" to "Completed" and
  "Failed" --- just don't like the word "Failed".  :P
* Can we make it so that when a player changes the timer
  before starting the game, the game "remembers" what the
  person put when the game is reset so they wouldn't have
  to change it before every game?  It turns out we won't know
  exactly how much time there is until we get to it because
  it's our last game and we have 12 teams (6 games) to get
  through.
* Have the Dare, Correct, and Incorrect buttons not appear
  until the game is started.
